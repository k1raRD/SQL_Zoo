# SQL_Zoo

Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/SQL_zoo).

### Functionality

This is the [SQL Zoo](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/databases/lessons/sql) project, simply completing the exercises at [sqlzoo.net](https://www.sqlzoo.net).

### Thoughts

Man, this was actually a really great project for learning SQL. It got tedious as it was one, after another, after another, after another, but eventually things finally started to click and some of it felt closer to second nature.
